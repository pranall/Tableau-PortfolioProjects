# Tableau-PortfolioProjects
Hi, these are all the projects I did in Tableau.


**Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage - January 2026**


I recently participated in Deloitte's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to be part of the team at Deloitte.
I was able to analyse data and create a dashboard. I practised using Tableau and Excel and built my data analysis skills in a real-world context. Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on technology problems for clients and I'm excited to apply these skills on a team at a company like Deloitte.
